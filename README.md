> [!IMPORTANT]
> FoxOS is **not a Linux distribution** and it does **not install Ubuntu** (or
> replace your server's operating system). It is a privileged management agent
> and web UI that runs on an existing Linux server.

FoxOS is designed for one simple outcome: clone it on a Linux server, start it,
and manage that same server from a browser. The host can be Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Arch, or another Linux distribution; FoxOS does
not use the host package manager for its own runtime.

## FoxOS v0.0.1 alpha

- **Real host overview** — hostname, Linux distribution, kernel, uptime, load,
  memory, and disk usage
- **Real Docker control** — list containers and start, stop, or restart them
- **Host terminal** — commands run directly in the Linux host namespaces
- **Host file access** — the Files app contains a `Sunucu` entry linked to
  the host root filesystem
- **Persistent FoxOS workspace** — desktop and trash data live under
  `.foxos-data/` and survive rebuilds
- **Server-side authentication** — salted scrypt password hashing, HTTP-only
  session cookies, protected management APIs, and basic login rate limiting
- **Single production service** — the React UI is built once and served by the
  Node.js agent on port `8080`

FoxOS is currently an **alpha**. See [Current limitations](#current-limitations)
before exposing it to other users.

## Supported hosts

| Host | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux server with Docker Engine + Compose v2 | Supported | FoxOS manages the actual Linux host |
| x86_64 or ARM64 Linux | Supported | Depends on standard multi-architecture Node images |
| macOS with Docker Desktop | Not supported for host management | It would manage Docker Desktop's Linux VM, not macOS |
| Windows with Docker Desktop | Not supported for host management | It would manage Docker Desktop's Linux VM, not Windows |
| Server without Docker | Not yet supported | A native systemd installer is not implemented |

## Install

### Requirements

- A Linux server
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- A user that can access the Docker daemon

### 1. Clone and start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OddAna/FoxOS.git
cd FoxOS
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer validates the environment and starts FoxOS. It does not install or
modify the host operating system.

### 2. Connect safely

FoxOS binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default because it has root-equivalent
server access. From your own computer:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 your-user@your-server-ip
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) and create the first
FoxOS account. Passwords must be at least 10 characters.

If you already have a private VPN or an HTTPS reverse proxy, copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and configure the bind address:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit FOXOS_BIND_ADDRESS and, when HTTPS is active, FOXOS_SECURE_COOKIE.
docker compose up -d
```

Do not publish FoxOS directly to the public internet. Read
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) first.

## How it controls the host

```text
Browser
  │  authenticated, same-origin HTTP
  ▼
FoxOS agent container (Node.js + built React UI)
  ├── host PID/mount/network namespaces via nsenter
  ├── host root mounted at /host
  ├── Docker Engine socket mounted read/write
  └── persistent FoxOS data mounted at /data
```

The agent container uses a small Debian-based runtime image for packaging. That
image is **not installed onto the host**. Terminal commands enter PID 1's Linux
namespaces and execute the host's own `/bin/sh`, package manager, files,
network, and processes.

This architecture is intentionally privileged. It is what makes full server
management possible, and it also means a compromised FoxOS session is equivalent
to compromised root access.

## Use

- Open **Sunucu** from the Dock to inspect host metrics and control Docker
  containers.
- Open **Terminal** to execute commands on the host.
- Open **Dosyalar**, then **Sunucu**, to browse the host filesystem.
- Use **Masaüstü** for FoxOS-only workspace files that should persist without
  cluttering the host root.

The FoxOS core container is marked as protected and cannot stop or restart itself
from the container list.

## Operations

```bash
# Status
docker compose ps

# Logs
docker compose logs -f foxos

# Restart
docker compose restart foxos

# Stop
docker compose down

# Update after pulling new code
git pull
./install.sh
```

### Change the port

Create a `.env` file:

```dotenv
FOXOS_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
FOXOS_PORT=9090
FOXOS_SECURE_COOKIE=false
```

Then run `docker compose up -d`.

### Reset the FoxOS password

This removes only the FoxOS login record; it does not delete workspace or server
files:

```bash
docker compose exec foxos rm -f /data/auth.json
docker compose restart foxos
```

Refresh the page to create a new account.

### Back up FoxOS data

Stop FoxOS and back up the local `.foxos-data/` directory. It contains the
authentication record, FoxOS desktop files, and trash.

## Current limitations

- Linux hosts only
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2 are required
- The terminal is command-based and not yet a full interactive PTY, so programs
  such as `vim`, `top`, and password prompts are not suitable yet
- File operations are synchronous; very large copy/move operations can take time
- No multi-user roles or permission levels
- No audit log yet
- An application marketplace is not included in v0.0.1
- HTTPS must be provided by a reverse proxy or private access layer

## Development

Run the backend and frontend separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
npm install
PORT=3001 DATA_ROOT=../.foxos-data HOST_ROOT=/ HOST_EXECUTION=local npm start

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` to
`http://localhost:3001`. In local development, host commands run with the
permissions of the user that started the backend.

Production uses the root [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), which builds the frontend and
ships a single runtime service.
